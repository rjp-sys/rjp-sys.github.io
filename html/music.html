    <h1 class="header">SONG OF THE MONTH: January 2025 </h1>

    <p class="txt">
        It’s Just Another New Year’s Eve, sung by Barry Manilow <br><br>
        I chose this song for January because I love all things Barry Manilow. This song <br>
        perfectly captures the assurance that this night – New Year’s Eve – is not as <br>
        important as we are prone to make it. It helps me keep the significance of New <br>
        Year’s Eve in perspective regardless of the mood I’m in when the famous ball <br>
        begins to drop. It is a chance to begin anew. It is a chance to remember and <br>
        recommit to those most important in our lives. <br>
        It’s another year, and we’ll do our best, just like last year and the year before, <br>
        because that’s all we can do. <br>
        I wish each of you a year of doing your best to live in love with God and your <br>
        neighbor. Do your best to be kind to others. Do your best to model peace and <br>
        contentment in a world gone crazy grabbing for more and more; more land, more <br>
        money, more fame. <br>
        God bless you this New Year’s Eve, and a happy 2025 to all. <br>

<h1 class="headertwo">  The SONG OF THE MONTH FOR FEBRUARY  2025 </h1>

<p class="txttwo"> 
  is Be Not Afraid. (Songwriters: Robert J Dufford, Be Not Afraid lyrics © Epoch Universal Publications Inc) <br><br>
  This song was taught to me by one of my hospice patients.  <br> 
  She was a precious lady who shared my love for music.  <br>
   Many of my chaplain visits were spent playing favorite pieces of music she wanted to hear or 
  singing together (as her strength allowed.) <br>
   I am particularly moved by the lines about "passing through raging waters" and walking "through the burning flames." <br> In December of 1992 one of
  my husband's churches was destroyed by fire. <br> This was followed in 1993 by record breaking floods across the midwest. <br>  We lived less than a mile from the Mississippi River at the time. <br>
  My husband's other church flooded.  We lived with the threat of our home flooding and ministered to others who had lost their homes and possessions.  <br> We could not drink our water, and every 
  night thunderstorms interrupted our sleep. <br> By mid-summer the kids were sleeping on the floor of our bedroom in sleeping bags. <br> This song reminds me that whatever difficulties may come our 
  way, we are not alone.  <br> We need not be afraid, because the Lord is with us through it all.  <br> That was the message that meant so much to my hospice patient, also. Her illness involved suffering 
  that no one should ever have to endure.  I know this song brought her comfort and encouragement.  <br> I hope it will encourage you as well. <br>
