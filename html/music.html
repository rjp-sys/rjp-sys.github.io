    <div class="card-body">
      <p><strong>It’s Just Another New Year’s Eve</strong><br>by Barry Manilow</p>
      <p>
        I chose this song for January because I love all things Barry Manilow. This song perfectly captures the assurance that this night—New Year’s Eve—is not as important as we are prone to make it. It helps me keep the significance of New Year’s Eve in perspective regardless of the mood I’m in when the famous ball begins to drop. It is a chance to begin anew. It is a chance to remember and recommit to those most important in our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s another year, and we’ll do our best, just like last year and the year before, because that’s all we can do. I wish each of you a year of doing your best to live in love with God and your neighbor. Do your best to be kind to others. Do your best to model peace and contentment in a world gone crazy grabbing for more and more; more land, more money, more fame.
      </p>
      <p>
        God bless you this New Year’s Eve, and a happy 2025 to all.

      <p><strong>Be Not Afraid</strong><br>(Robert J Dufford, © Epoch Universal Publications Inc)</p>
      <p>
        This song was taught to me by one of my hospice patients. She was a precious lady who shared my love for music. Many of my chaplain visits were spent playing favorite pieces of music she wanted to hear or singing together (as her strength allowed). I am particularly moved by the lines about "passing through raging waters" and walking "through the burning flames."
      </p>
      <p>
        In December of 1992 one of my husband's churches was destroyed by fire. This was followed in 1993 by record breaking floods across the midwest. We lived less than a mile from the Mississippi River at the time. My husband's other church flooded. We lived with the threat of our home flooding and ministered to others who had lost their homes and possessions. We could not drink our water, and every night thunderstorms interrupted our sleep. By mid-summer the kids were sleeping on the floor of our bedroom in sleeping bags.
      </p>
      <p>
        This song reminds me that whatever difficulties may come our way, we are not alone. We need not be afraid, because the Lord is with us through it all. That was the message that meant so much to my hospice patient, also. Her illness involved suffering that no one should ever have to endure. I know this song brought her comfort and encouragement. I hope it will encourage you as well.

    <p><strong>Grateful!</strong> — Gaither Vocal Band, 2023</p>
    <p>
      One of the most important themes in my life is gratitude. I love this song and its message which reminds me to count my blessings every day. This song also reminds me that we are blessed to be a blessing. We remember and serve those who shoulder invisible burdens. We pray for Christ-like love and joyful gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am grateful for many things. This week I am especially grateful for medical technology and all the preventative measures that protect us from serious illnesses in the future. What a hopeful time to be alive! Please enjoy this month’s song choice.
