<p class="one">One of the books that became a teaching resource at Rick’s House of Hope was Dr. Suess’s <br>
    “I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew.” We would reflect with the children about all the <br>
    troubles the character had on his journey to that wonderful land where they had “no troubles at all.” 
    However, the reputation of Solla Sollew turned out to be a fiction. Suess’s character decides instead 
    to dig deep and find the strength within that he needs to cope with his troubles.  <br>
    One of the final illustrations shows  him wielding something that looks like club or baseball bat. I always explain that 
    the bat is a symbol of our strength, not a tool of violence. <br>One year I wrote this song to help the children remember and learn the lessons we wanted to teach them:

        TROUBLES

    <p class="three">
        One little trouble (repeat)<br>
        Ouch! How it hurts! (repeat) <br>
        I never had any troubles before. <br>
        I’ll never have any troubles no more. <br>
        I’ll be careful, careful, careful.
        <br><br>
        Two little troubles (repeat) <br> 
        Come from front and back (repeat) <br> 
        I never had any troubles before. <br> 
        I’ll never have any troubles no more.<br> 
        I’ll be careful, careful, careful. 
        <br> <br> 
        Three little troubles!<br> 
        Four little troubles! <br> 
        See how fast they come! (repeat)<br> 
        I’m running away to sweet Solla Sollew<br> 
        On the trouble-free banks of the River Wah-hoo.  <br> 
        There’ll be peace, peace, peace.
        <br> <br> 
        More little troubles (repeat)<br> 
        (wailing) Why does this happen to me?  (repeat)<br> 
        My camel got sick. I got drafted for war.<br> 
        I fought floods and Poozers and bird-things galore.<br> 
        Oh, trouble, trouble, trouble.<br> 
        <br><br>
        (Slowly) One BIG trouble. (repeat)<br> 
        O, woe is me!  (repeat) <br> 
        I cannot go in to sweet Solla Sollew<br> 
        On the beautiful banks  of the River Wah-hoo.<br> 
        Oh, what shall I do?
        <br> <br> 
        (LOUD)  I still have troubles.  (repeat) <br> 
        But I won’t run away.  (repeat) <br> 
        I’m strong, I’m brave and I’m able to cope.<br> 
        I won’t run away, and I won’t give up hope<br> 
        When I’m troubled, troubled, troubled.
