            <h1 class="heading">10 things to know about Children and Grief</h1>
            <h2 class="subheading">by Robyn Plocher M. Div</h2>
            <p class="para">10. It is most appropriate to include any person of any age <br>
            who has shared a significant relationship with the deceased in <br>
            the visitation and funeral rituals. However, children should be <br>
            prepared for what they will see and experience through an age-<br> 
            appropriate talk with a trusted adult. Young children should not <br> 
            be expected to stay in line for the entire time at a 2+ hour visitation. <br>
            It is good to make arrangements to have another adult friend <br>
            with the children while parents are in the visitation chapel or <br>
            even have that friend take the children away from the visitation <br> 
            after they have had adequate time to view the body, express their <br> 
            feelings and be loved by family and friends in attendance. <br> 
            No hard and fast rules here. Every child's needs are unique. <br> 
            Most importantly, don't leave your child alone or unsupervised <br>
            during this emotionally charged and difficult time.</p>

            <p class="parb">9. For help talking to children about death and dying, avail yourself of many excellent <br>
            resources, such as this book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lifetimes-Beautiful-Explain-Death-Children/dp/0553344021" target="blank"><i>Lifetimes: The Beautiful Way to Explain Death to <br>Children by Bryan Mellonie (Author), Robert Ingpen (Author)</i></a><br> 
            </p>
            
            <p class="parc">8. Don't wait until there is a death in the family to talk about death and dying with <br> 
            your child. Death — from the maturing of the crops in the fields, the falling of leaves <br>
            in autumn to the baby bird that has fallen from its nest in the spring — is a natural <br>
            occurrence in the world around us. Children are naturally curious about death. About <br>
            the dead bird you may observe, "The bird can't breath anymore. It can't sing or fly <br>
            anymore. It can't eat anymore or feel any pain. The bird is dead. It's the same way <br> 
            when people die, too."
            </p>

            <p class="pard">7. Young children are literal and concrete thinkers. As parents and caregivers <br>
            we must choose our words wisely. A child whose baby brother died of SIDS <br>
            became extremely fearful of going to sleep. A child told "Grandpa is in heaven <br> 
            where he gets to eat ice cream all the time", started talking about wanting to <br>
            die so he could go to heaven and eat ice cream with Grandpa — which proved <br>
            very distressing to his family. I would be happy to assist you in finding the words <br> 
            that might best communicate what has happened for your child.</p>

            <p class="pare">6. There's a program to help prepare your children for the funeral visitation and saying "Good-bye." <br> 
            I taught the STAR Class (<b>S</b>pecial <b>T</b>ime to <b>A</b>lways <b>R</b>emember) as an After Care Specialist at <br>
            the beginning of the funeral visitation, usually while the family was consulting with the funeral director <br>
            and making final preparations in the Chapel. The STAR Class uses a coloring storybook to teach <br>
            about the things children may see and experience at the funeral home and cemetery, especially <br>
            what they may do or feel as they go in to see their loved one in the visitation room. Children also <br>
            participate in a remembrance craft project and prepare a "Star Message" to leave with their loved one. <br>
            Make arrangements for the STAR Class with your funeral director.</p>

            <p class="parf">5. Any child old enough to smile and experience pleasure is old enough to experience the pain of grief. <br>
            Children of different ages and developmental stages will experience grief differently, however. <br> 
            For example, A toddler for whom separation anxiety is a big issue will experience death as a <br>
            great and irrevocable separation. An older child (8 or 9) may be extremely curious about some aspects <br>
            of death and dying that are very uncomfortable for recently bereaved adults, such as deatils about what <br>
            happens to the body. While some of these responses may seem disturbing to adults, they are all <br>
            natural and even necessary for the child's development and understanding.   </p>

            <p class="parg">4. Like adults, children will experience the pain of grief. However, children do not possess the cognitive <br>
            or emotional maturity to know what to do with the intense feelings of sadness, guilt etc. Children <br>
            <i>play through</i> and <i>act out</i> their feelings. For example, a four-year old expressed what bereavement <br>
            specialists would call the "serching and yearning" phase of grief by playing with <br>
            Fisher Price Little People figures. Two children frantically race to find their dad,(who in real life has died) <br>
            but he always remains one step ahead of them and elusive -through the town, through the airport, through <br>
            the parking ramp. Then the child re-scripts the sad ending of the story <br>
            (expressing his profound wish that things could be different) and dad and two children enjoy a happy reunion <br>
            at the Little People Ice Cream Shoppe. With a bit of intention and practice, any caring adult can learn to listen with <br>
            their "third ear" (intuitively) to what children are teaching us about their grief thought their play.</p>

            <p class="parh">3. There are programs to support the grief process of children and youth: <a href="https://www.everystep.org/services/grief-loss/about-amanda-the-panda" target="blank">Amanada the Panda out of Des Moines, IA,</a> <br>
            children's services through <a href="https://www.cvhospice.org/services/grief-support/" target="blank">Cedar Valley Hospice</a> and other hospice programs like <a href="https://www.verafrenchmhc.org/services-for-children/ricks/" target="blank">Rick's Ray's of Hope serving eastern Iowa. </a><br>
            Such programs may offer children's grief support groups, individual counseling services, and/or weekend or summer camp experiences. </p>

            <p class="pari">2. There are risks to children and youth who do not receive necessary support for their grief. Some children will struggle <br>
            more because they are, by nature, more anxious or fearful. Some are more resilient, and with a little support will do <br>
            well in time. It can be difficult for a grieving parent to provide all the support their grieving children need. <br>
            Please don't overlook the needs of grieving children.</p>

            <p class="parj">1. You are a role model. This is a heavy responsibility, but right now the children in your life are watching you and learning <br>
            from you how to cope with change, upheaval, and the pain of loss. What are you teaching them? It's something to think about. </p>
