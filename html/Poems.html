        <p class="para">At this time, I am also introducing some of my poetry. This first poem is <br>
            called “The Children and the Sea.” It was written in July 1988 in Tallin, Estonia as <br>
            I participated in a Peace Mission Tour to the Soviet Union. The Estonians were <br>
            very proud of their heritage. They were polite, but very firmly corrected us if we <br>
            called them “Russian” or spoke Russian words to them. “I am Estonian. Please <br>
            speak Estonian to me.”</p>
        <p class="parb">I had the privilege, along with other ordained clergy in our group, to bring a <br>
            greeting to the Wednesday night congregation of the Tallin Methodist Church. To <br>
            conclude my greeting I sang the song, “Love in Any Language” as sung by Sandi <br>
            Patti. Imagine my surprise when the congregation began to sing along. The youth <br>
            of the church had recently returned from a large conference where they learned the <br>
            song and had taught it to the congregation. So, we raised our voices, singing <br>
            “Love in Any Language” in English, Estonian and Russian. It was one of the <br>
            greatest moments of my life.</p>

            <p class="parc">The people of Tallin were open and friendly. The children at the daycare we <br>
                visited were happy. This poem was written to celebrate and honor the spirit of the <br>
                people of Estonia.</p>

            <p class="txt">We dance and play, skipping over the rocks. <br>
                There is music in our soul. <br>
                Our laughter cools and refreshes. <br>
                The sunlight is our smile. <br>
                We are young and we are old. It matters not. <br>
                Our call to you the same, <br>
                “Come play with us! Come play with us!” <br>
                We’ll dance and play some more.  <br>
                Sing and dance. Go ‘round and ‘round! <br>
                It is the age-old song. <br>
                Never did music sound so sweet <br>
                As when sung by the children and the sea.</p>
