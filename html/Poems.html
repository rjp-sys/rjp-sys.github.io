    At this time, I am also introducing some of my poetry. This first poem is called “The Children and the Sea.” It was written in July 1988 in Tallin, Estonia as I participated in a Peace Mission Tour to the Soviet Union. The Estonians were very proud of their heritage. They were polite, but very firmly corrected us if we called them “Russian” or spoke Russian words to them. “I am Estonian. Please speak Estonian to me.”
  </p>
  <p class="parb">
    I had the privilege, along with other ordained clergy in our group, to bring a greeting to the Wednesday night congregation of the Tallin Methodist Church. To conclude my greeting I sang the song, “Love in Any Language” as sung by Sandi Patti. Imagine my surprise when the congregation began to sing along. The youth of the church had recently returned from a large conference where they learned the song and had taught it to the congregation. So, we raised our voices, singing “Love in Any Language” in English, Estonian and Russian. It was one of the greatest moments of my life.

    The people of Tallin were open and friendly. The children at the daycare we visited were happy. This poem was written to celebrate and honor the spirit of the people of Estonia.

    We dance and play, skipping over the rocks.<br>
    There is music in our soul.<br>
    Our laughter cools and refreshes.<br>
    The sunlight is our smile.<br>
    We are young and we are old. It matters not.<br>
    Our call to you the same,<br>
    “Come play with us! Come play with us!”<br>
    We’ll dance and play some more.<br>
    Sing and dance. Go ‘round and ‘round!<br>
    It is the age-old song.<br>
    Never did music sound so sweet<br>
    As when sung by the children and the sea.
