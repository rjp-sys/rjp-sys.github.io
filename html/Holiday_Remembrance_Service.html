<p class="own2"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PBEMfbWq_Y" target="1blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PBEMfbWq_Y</a></p>
<p class="content">Snow is falling Christmas eve <br>
  Lights are coming on up and down the street<br>
  The sound of carols fills the air<br>
  And people rushing home, families everywhere<br>
  Putting candles in the windows<br>
  Lights upon the tree<br>
  But there’s no laughter in this house, not like there used to be <br>
  There’re just a million little memories that remind me you’re not here<br>
  It’s just a different kind of Christmas this year
  </p>
  <p class="content">In the evening fires glow<br>
    Dancing underneath the mistletoe<br>
    A letter left from Santa Claus<br>
    Won’t be the same this year in our house because<br>
    <br>
    There’s one less place set at the table<br>
    One less gift under the tree<br>
    And a brand-new way to take their place inside of me<br>
    I’m unwrapping all these memories<br>
    Fighting back the tears<br>
    It’s just a different kind of Christmas this year<br>
    </p>

  <p class="content">
    There’re voices in the driveway<br>
     Family’s right outside the door<br>
    And we’ll try to make this Christmas like the ones we’ve had before<br>
    As we gather round the table, I see joy on every face<br>
    And I realize what’s still alive is the legacy you made<br>
    <br>
    It’s time to put the candles in the windows, the lights upon the tree<br>
    It’s time to fill this house with laughter like it used to be<br>
    Just because you’re up in heaven, doesn’t mean you’re not near<br>
    It just a different kind of Christmas<br>
    It’s just a different kind of Christmas this year<sup>5</sup>

<p class="content">SENDING FORTH (read in unison) </p>
<p class="content">
  Love never ends.<br>
  When all else fails, love remains.<br>
  We give thanks for the gift of love made known through the lives of those we have honored on this day.<br>
  We give thanks for the light and love (your loved one’s name) shared to make us the people we are today<br>
  And for that part of (your loved one’s name) that lives and grows in us<br>
  We give thanks for his / her life that in love will never end.<br>
  Let those of us who remain in this life draw closer to one another, <br>
  And let us serve one another in love.<br>
  May the power of eternal love order our days and guard our nights. 
  Amen.<sup>4</sup>

<p class="own4">Service Notes</p>
<img  class="own5"  src="/res/hoilday.png" alt="music note">
<p class="content">As host, deciding when to hold the service may be the most difficult choice with which you are faced. 
  Most of us feel that stores putting out Christmas merchandise in October is very premature and even ridiculous. On the other hand, Christmas music in the stores and on the radio, Christmas trees and light displays in early November are a reality. 
  They can be a significant trigger for grieving folks.  My professional choice has been to offer a memorial service the weekend before Thanksgiving. 
  People are likely to be beyond denying the holiday season is upon them <i>and</i> open to the help and support our service provides. 
</p>
<p class="content"><sup>1</sup> Some professionals have found this song too “depressing” and without hope. Respectfully, I disagree. 
   I am attempting to create divine momentum.  To do that, I need to create a service that acknowledges the angst the bereaved may be experiencing about the coming holiday season. 
    They may be experiencing what Alan Wolfelt calls “paradoxical emotionality” -a mix of happy and sad feelings.    
    They may be anxious.  In my opinion, <i>Where Are You Christmas</i> acknowledges both the pain of grief and the hope of Christmas. 
   <i>“If you have love in your heart and your mind, you will feel like Christmas all the time…The joy of Christmas stays here inside us, fills each and every heart with love.”</i>
</p>
<p class="content"><sup>2</sup>Dr. Wolfelt of the Center for Loss and Life Transition has created several superb videos addressing the subject of holiday grief.  These are available on YouTube.  If you want to use a video as your “message” for the service, I suggest: </p>

<p class="content">Alternatively, a chaplain or other experienced speaker could address the subject.
  At the end of these notes, I have included one message I delivered at a remembrance service. </p>
  <p class="content"><sup>3</sup>Tipping the unlit candle into the flame of the larger pillar candle will help to prevent wax dripping on the floor or hands. </p>
<p class="content"><sup>4</sup> Adapted from A <i>Service of Committal</i>, The United Methodist Book of Worship (Copyright 1992,The United Methodist Publishing House) p. 157</p>
<p class="content"><sup>5</sup>As host of the service, I always print the lyrics of songs that are played. I assume there may be people present who cannot hear or understand the lyrics on</p>
<p class="content">the recording for a whole host of reasons.  Also, music can stir deep emotions. Even after hearing the song attendees may not remember the words or may want to hear the song again.

<p class="own6">A Sample Message for Holiday Remembrance Service</p>
<p class="content">Holidays are stressful under the best of <br>circumstances.</p>
<p class="content">Imagine…</p>
<p class="content">Shopping on Black Friday for a new dress or suit to <br>wear to a loved one’s funeral. <br><br>
  Getting a phone call at 4 a.m. Thanksgiving Day that<br> an elderly parent is being transported to the emergency room.<br><br>

  Sitting vigil at a loved one’s bedside from <br>Thanksgiving Day through mid-December when they die. <br><br>

  I feel like something of an expert on grief during the <br>holidays because I have done all those things. Death <br>and grief are two things that do not take a holiday.<br><br>

  When a loved one has died, and the first (or second)<br> holiday season rolls around it can make our grief more<br> acute and painful.<br><br>

  Today I would like to share with you a few specific <br>tips for coping with the holidays after loss.  These<br> are strategies I have learned in my own life<br> experience and I have been taught by other bereaved individuals.
  </p>
<p class="big">•</p>
<p class="own7">Set our intentions but stay flexible.</p>
<p class="own8"> Bereaved</p>
  <p class="content2">individuals who have the most difficulty with the <br>holiday season are those who give little thought<br> to the challenges they will face. 
   It is good to <br>think about things that will be expected of us<br> socially and how these will impact us emotionally.<br>
    We can plan what we want to participate in and<br> what we think will be too difficult.  
    Consider<br> what can be done to take the sting out of an <br>activity or gathering.  
    Even if we plan to do<br> something, we may find we need to leave early or<br> change our plans at the last minute. That’s all<br>
    right. This is a time when our needs take <br> priority.  It is not selfish.  It is self-care!
