        <h3 class="headerb">By Robyn J. Plocher, M.Div.</h3>
        <h1 class="subheaderb">Founder of Rick's House of Hope*</h1>
        <p class="para">John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, is remembered for the penetrating 
        question he frequently asked of the church leaders and members alike: "And how is it with your soul."</p>

        <p class="parb">Such a question, taken seriously, may be difficult for even the most spiritually <br> 
        mature among us to answer. As a spiritual caregiver for grieving children and <br> adolescents,
        I am concerned with this same question. The paradox of my work is that<br>
        children are at once  both more and less prepared to answer that question. A<br>  
        child is a paradox almost by definition, selfishly demanding and refusing to share one <br>
        moment, then giving unreservedly of love in the form of wet peanut butter and jelly kisses <br> 
        the next. He fights with his sister over the stupid way she plays a game one day and <br> fights the 
        class bully who is picking on his sister the next. A child's faith, in themselves, <br>
        their parents, and God is simple and unfettered by traditional theology, ecclesiology,<br>
        eschatology or any other "ology" of which they have never heard. They accept the <br>
        stories from their faith tradition unquestioningly for the most part. When they do ask <br>
        "Why?" it is with the complete expectation that the question can and will be answered. <br>
        The emotional and spiritual scars of traumatic loss can divert a youngster from their <br>     
        spiritual journey. As spiritual caregivers, we can help ensure they continue on the path <br>
        that leads to healing, restoration and hope that can be found in the traditions of their <br>
        particular faith.</p>

        <p class="parc">When a child is injured after falling off their bicycle, we set their bones, stitch <br>  
        their cuts, and reassure them they will recover in a matter of weeks. Assuming the <br>  
        accident did not involve a critical injury or death, the youngster will probably not suffer <br>
        permanent emotional scars from the experience.</p>
 
        <p class="pard">However, if the child is involved in a car accident that takes her mother's life and <br>
        leaves herself critically injured, quite another scenario is possible. This little girl may <br>
        spend months in the hospital from recovering from her injuries. When she leaves the <br>
        hospital she will be confronted for the first time with the reality her of mother's death. As a <br> 
        young child, she does not possess the cognitive ability to understand the permanent <br>
        nature of death. She lacks the skills to articulate her intense feelings of grief. As the <br>
        shock of her loss continues to wear off, she may experience a host of traumatic stress <br>
        reactions, including nightmares, flashbacks, trouble concentrating, failing academic <br>
        performance, terror of riding in the car or on the school bus, outburst of anger and many <br>
        others.</p>

        <p class="pare"> Adults would prefer to avoid the knowledge that a child's heart can be so broken- <br>
        her soul so deeply hurt. Yet, it happens every day. Help and hope are possible, however. <br>
        Professional spiritual care providers can effectively minister to the hurting children in <br>
        their churches, hospitals and agencies. Following are suggestions for beginning: </p>
        <div class="pagebreak"> </div>

        <p class="page2"> 1. <i>Offer the ministries of presence and active listening.</i> If you want to know what <br>
        is going on in the heart and soul of a grieving child, ask them. We must not assume <br>
        because we are adults that we automatically know what is best for the child. An adult who <br> 
        is also grieving is not the best person to provide the comfort and support needed by a <br>
        grieving child. Grieving parents need help from other adults in the child's life-the <br> 
        teachers, scout leaders, pastors, physicians and other relatives- to make sure the needs of <br>
        the child are not overlooked. Children experience the same feelings of grief  that adults <br>
        do, but they do not express these feelings the same way. Adults can learn to hear the <br>
        language of play, such as drawings, puppet play, sculpting with clay and imaginative role <br>    
        play in which children engage. As in any healing ministry, helping grieving or <br> 
        traumatized children begins with the willingness to be present and listen.</p>

        <p class="page2a">Children are just as eager as adults to tell their story. When asked to draw a <br>
        picture that tells the story of what happened to them, children and adolescents are almost <br>
        always anxious and able to share the details of their traumatic loss. Simply asking a child <br>
        to draw a picture of himself may reveal much. Bobby**, who discoverd his mother's <br> 
        body after she died by suicide, drew himself with huge terrified eyes, hair wildly <br>
        standing on end, and with his teeth gritted together. By engaging Bobby in this simple <br>
        exercise, We learn that behind the happy facade Bobby presents to the world is a <br>
        youngster who still harbors much terror for the awful scene he witnessed.</p>

        <p class="page2b">Learn to hear the story in the only way the child can tell it, through creative <br> 
        expressions of art and play and in behaviors adult often call acting out. This is the <br> 
        beginning of understanding how it is with the child's soul</p> 

        <div class="Break"> </div>

        <p class="page2c">2. <i>Offer ministries of unconditional love.</i> Expect grieving children to carry a <br> 
        burden of guilt. Young children are extremely ego-centric. In their minds, they are the <br>
        center of the universe. They believe in the power of wishful thinking, believing things <br> 
        can and will happen just because they wished them so. Young boys especially possess an <br> 
        exaggerated sense of their own power. This translates into an exaggerated sense of <br> 
        responsibility. Eight year old Jimmy believes he could have wrestled a hunting rifle out <br>
        of his mothers arms and thereby kept her from using the gun on herself. Six years after <br>
        the accident that took his father's life. Charles believes he could have grabbed the <br> 
        steering wheel and taken control of the car if only he had been awake to see that the <br>
        accident was about to happen. However, Charles was only eighteen months old and strapped in his <br>
        car seat at the time of the accident.</p>

        <p class="page2d">Children, because they are children, cannot see the fallacies in these beliefs. We <br> 
        can and should speak to them of adult choices for which they bear no responsibility. <br>
        However, the best antidote for such an awful burden of guilt is the continual reassurance <br>
        of the child's inherent goodness through unconditional acceptance of him. Even when <br>
        their behavior is shocking, disturbing or outright bizarre, we communicate that they are <br>
        loveable and precious to us. Children from Judeo-Christian faith traditions may be <br>
        affirmed of their inherent worth as a child of God, precious in God's sight. The story of <br>
        the prodigal son, for example, takes on personal meaning as the story of a child who failed <br>
        or made mistakes but still found extravagant love in the arms of a caring father.</p>
        
        <p class="page2e">At the last session of our trauma recovery group every child receives two <br>
        certificates. One is for completion of the program. The other is a certificate that incudes <br> 
      </p>

      <p class="page3a">the spiritual meaning and significance of their given name. It is a parting gift and another  <br>
      reminder of the youngster's unique relationship with God. The discovery and sharing of <br> 
      the meaning of one's name is ofter most poignant: 

    </p>

    <p class="page3b"> Jessica, whose name means "God Beholds" <br>
    Gabriel, whose name means "God is my strength" <br> 
    and Matthew, whose name means "Gift of God".</p>

    <p class="page3c">The light of unconditional love illumines and overcomes the darkness of doubt and <br>
    guilt that clouds a grieving child's soul.</p>

    <div class="Break"> </div>
   
    <p class="page3d">3. <i>Provide ministries of reconciliation.</i> After the spiritual caregiver has been <br>
    entrusted with the child's story, it is then time to facilitate reconciliation between the <br>
    child and her parent or guardian. The youngster has intuitively known that the primary <br>
    adult(s) in her life is not able to offer the support she needs. She has seen the adult's pain <br>
    and grief and has invested a great deal of energy into protecting the parent or guardian <br>
    from further pain and stress. She has kept much of her story, her feelings and her <br>
    questions to herself. In this case, reconciliation refers to all the ways in which she may <br>
    be assisted to reconnect with her primary caregiver. As spiritual caregivers, we help build <br>
    bridges of communication and trust that make this reconciliation possible.</p>

    <p class="page3e">We educate, teaching adults about the unique characteristics of childhood grief.<br>
    We provide them with information that will help them to understand the developmental <br>
    needs of their grieving child. Parents and guardians are taught what grief reactions are <br>
    considered normal for children and teenagers, as well as those which indicate a need for <br>
    professional intervention. </p>

    <p class="page3f">Spiritual caregivers shepherd the adults, guiding and directing them in giving <br>
    responses that will support their youngsters and encourage future sharing. and encourage future sharing. <br>
    It is best to be as specific as possible. Most parents are not trained in active listening skills. Suggest <br>
    use of the following responses when their child shares with them:</p>

    <p class="page3g">"That's really interesting" <br> "Tell me more about that" <br> 
      "I didn't know you felt that way" <br> "I feel this way sometimes too" </p>

    <p class="page3h">These responses validate the child's experience of grief and reveal that it is all right for <br>
      her to trust and share feelings with her parent.</p>
    
    <p class="page3i">Now it is time to provide an opportunity for the youngster to share her story with <br> 
      her parent or guardian in a safe and secure environment. While difficult, this can be a <br> 
      very moving experience for all involved. In many cases, tears are shed, affirmation is <br> 
      shared, and much love is expressed. It is a healing experience that helps the child to <br>
      disconnect from you, the spiritual caregiver, and reconnect in a relationship of trust with <br>
      her parent or guardian.</p>

    <p class="page3j">Christy was thirteen when it became obvious that her father would not win his battle <br>
      against cancer. As our time working together progressed, I invited Christy's mother in to <br>
      hear from her daughter just how this sad and stressful time was affecting her. It was <br> 
      obvious there was a bond of trust between the two, as Christy shared very openly the <br> 
      pictures she had drawn and the things she had written in her workbook.</p> 
      
      <div class="pagebreak"> </div>

      <p class="page4a">There were long periods of silence as mother absorbed all the things that Christy was sharing. <br>
        She had not realized until this time the depth of Christy's sorrow and depression, her fears and her worries. <br>
        She had not understood the amount of effort Christy was expending to control her own <br>
        emotions so as to avoid adding to the stress in the household. The culmination of this <br> 
        session was the sharing of much empathy between this young woman and her mother. <br> 
        Her mother embraced her, literally and figuratively, with an abundance of love and <br> 
        acceptance that undoubtedly helped them both face the death of Christy's father just two <br> 
        weeks following this session.</p>

      <div class="Break"> </div>

      <p class="page4b"><i>The Bottom Line: Offer them hope.</i> Hope is a realistic and adaptive response to the <br> 
        experience of extreme stress or loss in which a person acquires a patient and confident <br> 
        surrender to those circumstances that are beyond his control. <i>(Adapted from Dictionary <br>
        of Pastoral Care and Counseling, Rodney Hunter, ed)</i> Most adults prefer to avoid as <br> 
        long as possible the realization that children can suffer such depths of despair that their <br>
        ability to hope is stunted. Yet, "these are the children who pass through my door. everyday." <br>
        "As spiritual caregivers, we are in a unique position to ask of them. "How is it with <br> 
        your soul?" With patience, grace and understating we can learn to listen to the answers <br>
        they share. The children we serve will likely enter adulthood with great strength and an <br>
        ability to cope with life's crises because we have taken the time to care. They will have <br>
        learned to face crisis as a natural part of their total life experience, as something to be <br>
        coped with, not paralyzed by. To paraphrase John Wesley, "The children are our parish. <br>
        Let us offer them hope." There are few opportunities for ministry that offer greater <br>
        rewards than ministry to grieving children. </p>

        <p class="astrisk">* Rick's house of hope is currently called Rick's Rays of Hope. <br>
