        <h2 class="subheading">    Text:  Luke 10:25-37 (NIV)</h2>
        <h3 class="subsub"> <b>The Parable of the Good Samaritan</b> </h3>
        <p class="para">
        
           <sup>25</sup>  On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. <br>“Teacher,” 
             he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”  <br> <br>
          <sup>26</sup> “What is written in the Law?” he replied. “How do you read it?”  <br> <br>
            <sup>27</sup> He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all <br> your 
             soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’[a]; and, ‘Love <br> your 
             neighbor as yourself.’[b]”  <br> <br>
            <sup>28</sup>“You have answered correctly,” Jesus replied. “Do this and you will live.”  <br> <br>
            <sup>29</sup>But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”  <br> <br>
            <sup>30</sup> In reply Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, <br> 
            when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat <br>
             him and went away, leaving him half dead. <sup>31</sup> A priest happened to be going <br>
              down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other <br>
              side. <sup>32</sup> So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed <br>
               by on the other side. <sup>33</sup> But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the <br>
                man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. <sup>34</sup> He went to him and <br>
                 bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his <br>
                  own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. <sup>35</sup> The next day he <br>
                  took out two denarii[c] and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he <br>
                   said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you <br> may have.’  <br> <br>
          
                   <sup>36</sup> “Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”  <br> <br>
                   <sup>37</sup> The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.” <br> Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”  <br> 
            
        </p>    
        
        <p class="parb">I remember driving home the twenty miles or so from the rural Indiana <br> parish I served.  I drove in a blinding
             rainstorm when one of those ominous <br> red lights on the dashboard went on and my car slowly ground to a halt. <br>  No matter how
              much I pushed or pumped the accelerator, I was literally <br> “dead in the water.” <br> <br> 

                I had managed to steer the car to the side of the road, then sat there <br> wondering what to do next. Without even an umbrella,
                 any walk through the <br> driving sheets of rain seemed like a very bad idea. <br>  <br> 

                On the other hand, I was not in a patient mood, and it didn’t take long <br> for me to decide that any action was better than no 
                action.  So, out I went <br> into the rain.  I aimed for a farmhouse I could just barely make out in the<br>  distance. The thought 
                ran through my mind, “What if no one is home?” I <br> dismissed that with, “I’ll cross that bridge when and IF I get to it.” <br> <br>  

                I’d only gone a few yards when a car pulled up beside me.  Two men <br> were in the front seat.  The young man closest to me rolled 
                down his window. <br> While I hesitated, the driver called out, “It’s o.k.  We’re delivering <br> papers for the Muncie Star.”  Then
                 he quickly told me their names.  I <br> decided that if they were untrustworthy, they probably would not have told <br> me all this
                  and I jumped in. The men graciously drove me all the way <br> home, delivering me safely to my family.  They were indeed my good <br> Samaritans that day.  <br> <br> 

                To trust or not to trust. Travelers and sojourners of every age have <br> faced that decision.  Is the hotel clerk who’s locking away my valuables <br> trustworthy? 
                 Is that hitchhiker really in trouble, or just looking for a victim to <br>  prey on?  Did he give me accurate directions through safe areas of the <br>
                     unfamiliar city? <br> <br>

                Things may not turn out as well as they did for me that rainy Sunday. <br> 
                Another time, same car, same problem – different road, I was on Interstate <br>
                74 between Richmond and Indianapolis when the car broke down. By now I <br>
                had learned how to take care of this problem: Give the engine some time to <br>  
                cool down, then add water to the radiator and drive to the nearest exit to <br>
                call my husband.  A simple, manageable plan.  Except this time <br>
                my would-be good Samaritan gave me the creeps. He was insistent that I <br>
                could get in his car and he would drive me ANYWHERE I needed to go, <br>
                even all the way to my meeting in Indianapolis, which was still 75 miles <br>
                away. In every way he could think of he tried to persuade me to get into his <br>
                car.  The more he pushed, the more I resisted.  When I had my car running <br>
                again, he insisted on following me to the exit and to the truck stop where I <br>
                would go in and call home.  I couldn’t shake him.  I didn’t have much cash,  <br>
                but when I got to the truck stop, I asked for a table and ordered a piece of <br>
                pie.  It was a public place full of many people.  If he bothered me here, I <br>
                could tell the waitress what was going on and have her call the police. <br> <br>

                Maybe this guy would have delivered me safely to my meeting, but I <br>
                try not to think about “what ifs” because the truth is I did not trust him. <br>
                 Travelers, especially those in an unfamiliar country or city, must be alert to <br>
                 discern who they can and cannot trust or what parts of town are not safe.<br>
                These are real concerns. <br> <br>

                It was that way on the road to Jericho in Jesus’ day.  It was steep and <br>
                treacherous in more ways than one. The way was full of many places <br>
                where thieves and bandits could hide until unsuspecting or vulnerable <br> 
                travelers could be attacked, beaten, robbed and left for dead.  It was all too <br>
                familiar a scenario Jesus painted when he told the story of what we have <br>
                come to call “the good Samaritan.”  <br> <br>

                As the story goes, this man was beaten, robbed and left for dead <br>
                along the road to Jericho. A priest and a Levite both happened along the <br>
                road.  Priests alone were allowed to make sacrifices in the temple and at <br>
                the sacrificial alter.  Levites traced their ancestry to the tribe of Levi. <br>
                Levites had duties in public worship also, such as singers, gatekeepers, <br>
                guardians, judges and craftsmen. The priest and the Levite saw the man <br>
                who had been robbed and both passed by on the other side of the road. <br>
                This seems shocking.  It as certainly unfortunate for the injured man. <br>
                However, Jesus’ audience understood why the priest and Levite should not <br>
                be judged too harshly.  If either of them had touched the man and found he <br>
                was already dead, as it appeared he might be, they would become ritually <br>
                unclean and unable to perform their temple duties. (Imagine your pastor <br>
                coming to worship, serving communion and shaking hands, all while positive for CoVid-19.) <br> <br>

                Then a Samaritan came along. Samaritans were hated and despised <br>
                by the Jews and, frankly, the feeling was mutual.  That’s why what Jesus <br>
                says next is such a shock.  It was this Samaritan who stopped and cared <br>
                for the beaten man.  He gave him first aid. Then him took him to a hotel <br>
                and paid in advance for the inn keeper to care for the man for several days. <br>
                He returned a few days later just to make sure that man was recovering <br>
                and that the hotel manager was properly reimbursed.  <br> <br>

                Those listening to Jesus’ story were incredulous. Why would <br>
                someone like THAT – a Samaritan of all things, go to such trouble to help <br>
                someone?  To help a JEW?  Their sworn enemy? <br> <br>

                Remember, A man had asked Jesus, “Who is my neighbor?”  That’s <br>
                the point of the whole story.  If I am to love God with all my heart, mind and <br>
                strength and love my neighbor as myself, then, who are we really talking <br>
                about?  Who is my neighbor? <br> <br>

                Jesus’ story of the good Samaritan turns all our preconceived notions <br> 
                and pat answers upside down and inside out.  Our neighbor, Jesus wants <br>
                us to know, is most likely the person we’d least expect. Imagine, a <br>
                Samaritan being a good neighbor to a Jew?  Jesus might as well have said <br>
                our neighbor is the Muslim, democrats, republicans, feminists, the Chinese, <br>
                immigrant, mentally ill or any other of many groups of people who make us <br>
                uncomfortable.  Who we consider our enemy.  They are the scorned, the <br>
                excluded and the outright hated of our society. <br> <br>

                Jesus may not have mentioned our scorned ones all by name, but the <br>
                spirit and intent of the message is clear. Loving God and loving your <br>
                neighbor means possessing compassion for and a willingness to serve <br>
                those people you would just as soon never have to interact with.  People <br>
                you would rather not include in your life and your love.  The story means <br>
                that one day when we are in need, we might be really surprised to find one <br>
                of these people who make us so uncomfortable might be the very person <br>
                 who stops to help us and care for us.  <br> <br>

                This, friends, is the wonderful, surprising, and challenging life and <br>
                work the Lord calls us to.  Thanks be to God.  Lord, make me more like <br>
                Jesus. Amen.</p>
