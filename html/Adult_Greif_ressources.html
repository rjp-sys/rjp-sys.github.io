             <p class="lettera">"Adults often think of children as being 'resilient' or 'too young to understand death and grief.'
              The truth is...all children are vulnerable to feelings of sadness, depression, anger, fear and anxiety when someone they love dies. Any
              child old enough to laugh and experience pleasure is also old enough to experience the pain of grief." So Robyn Plocher writes to
              parents and caregivers of breaved children.</p>
            <p class="letterb">The holiday season, regardless of what traditions your family practices, can be difficult 
              when someone you love has died. As you struggle to decide what you will do and who you will be with when the holiday
              arrives it is quite likely you haven't given much thought to the children in the family.</p>
            <p class="letterc">Children pick up on our stress and distress. Children have their own worries about how the holidays will be different.
              Children grieve the absence of their family member, too.
            </p>
            <p class="letterd">This workbook is designed to help children express, through words and pictures, what family traditions are most
              important to them and what worries they have. The workbook is designed to facilitate communication between the child and his/her parent
            or caregiver. Sit with your child while they complete the workbook or make sure they share it with you after it is completed. The last
            page is a list of family activites and projects you can work on together. Use these pages to begin a dialogue and to inform your
            decisions about holiday observances.</p>
